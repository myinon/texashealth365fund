# Texas Health 365 Fund

The site is redone using CSS Grid so as to take advantage of positioning and ordering of elements while still being fully committed to a responsive and fluid design. All of the JavaScript is also reworked using just plain, vanilla JavaScript, and removing jQuery so as to make the page lighter. The JavaScript uses the new IntersectionObserver API to try and off load some of the work done while scrolling the page. The slideshow uses CSS Animations in order to order to produce the fade in-out effect. As such, no JavaScript controls have been added to advance through the slideshow. The slideshow can be paused by placing the mouse over the images.
