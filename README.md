# Texas Health 365 Fund

The site is redone using CSS Grid so as to take advantage of positioning and ordering of elements while still being fully committed to a responsive and fluid design. All of the JavaScript is also reworked using just plain, vanilla JavaScript, and removing jQuery so as to make the page lighter. The JavaScript uses the new IntersectionObserver API to try and off load some of the work done while scrolling the page. The slideshow is the only piece missing from this page and may be added in at a later date.
